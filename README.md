# easy-alias
Easy Alias's for bash

# Setup
Your system needs to have 'echo' which every 21st century computer has
You dont need any python requirments but setting an alias (Easily don't worry) is highy recommmened

``` $ echo alias al='"python3 ~/<Path-to-program>"' >> ~/.bashrc```

then reload the shell with:

```source ~/.bashrc```

# Usage
``` $ al <alias>="<command>"  ```

At the moment I cannot get the program to automatially reload the shell so please manually do so with:

```source ~/.bashrc```

After every command

The program has been completely written by myself and I would appreciate that if you like the program to leave a star!
